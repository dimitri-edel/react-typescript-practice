# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

# OBJECTIVES OF THE PRACTICE

* Cover all the necessary Typescript features that are necessary for writing React applications
* Create a i18n feature for the application

# SETTING UP THE REACT APP

I am using this YouTube video totorial as a starting point : https://youtu.be/665UnOGx3Pg

Furthermore, I am going to use Google's Gemini and GitHub Copilot for further assistance.

In the video the tutor suggest that the project be created using Vite, so I will do the same. (Instead of using ***npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript***)

1. Run the command : ***npm create vite@latest .*** (Mind the dot that signifies that it the project is to be created in the current folder)
2. Vite gives you a list of possible frameworks that can be used. Select **React**.
3. Select **TypeScript**

As one can see in the terminal, in order to run the app you will need to ***npm install*** first and then ***npm run dev***
